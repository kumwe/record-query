 * Choice of what a browse page carries back: field values, hydrated relations, and aggregates.

 * A stored record is usually wider than the caller needs, so the projection is how a caller names the
 * part it wants and nothing else. Empty `fields` means every field the definition exposes to readers,
 * which is the common case; naming fields narrows both the columns the compiler selects and the view
 * the caller receives, and the compiler adds back any field a requested formula depends on. `includes`
 * are resolved once for the whole page rather than per row, and `aggregates` run over every matching
 * record rather than over the page, so neither cost grows with the page size. The three counts are
 * capped here, at construction, because they are what decide how much work one page of a browse does.

 * Leaf of a business-record filter tree that tests one field against a bounded set of literal values.
 *
 * This is how a browse says "any of these" without paying for an OR group per member: the whole set
 * compiles to a single `IN` list and costs one operation against the query's budget. Every member is
 * checked as the node is built, against the same closed set of bounded types a comparison may bind and
 * never null, since absence is `NullFilter`'s job; the list is capped at a hundred so a caller cannot
 * push an unbounded `IN` into a prepared statement. A negated set is spelled with a `CASE` expression
 * rather than SQL `NOT IN`, so a record whose column is null counts as being outside the set instead of
 * silently dropping out of the result.

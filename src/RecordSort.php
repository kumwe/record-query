 * One ordering key of a browse, together with where its empty values belong.

 * Ordering decides pagination here, not just presentation: the compiler turns the sorts into a keyset
 * `ORDER BY` and seeks the next page by comparing against the last row's values, with the record
 * identity appended as the final tie-breaker. That is why null placement belongs to the sort instead
 * of being left to the engine — it compiles to an explicit rank expression, so the order is the same
 * on every platform and a cursor issued under it can reproduce it. The field must be declared sortable
 * and back exactly one column the engine can seek on portably, which the compiler enforces when it
 * resolves the handle; a composite field, or one stored as text, JSON or a blob, is refused there.

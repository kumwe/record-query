 * filters instead. `Equal` and `NotEqual` are the only cases accepted against a composite field —
 * one the definition spreads over several physical columns — because ordering such a field has no
 * single meaning; the other four also insist on a column the engines order identically, which rules
 * out boolean and identifier columns that only compare for equality.

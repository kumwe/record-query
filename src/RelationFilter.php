/**
 * Predicate that holds when a record's related records satisfy a filter of their own.
 *
 * This is the only way a browse reaches past the table it is querying. It compiles to a correlated
 * `EXISTS` over the related table — reached by a direct column, a junction table, an owned-line table
 * or the canonical inverse, whichever the installed schema provides — rather than to a join, so a
 * record is still returned at most once however many of its relations match. The nested filter is
 * compiled against the target definition, resolved and fenced exactly like the queried one, so its
 * handles are the target's own and only related records inside the request scope that are not
 * soft-deleted are visible to it. Each hop costs another correlated subquery, which is why hops are
 * counted apart from nesting depth and `RecordQuerySpecification` allows only two of them.

 * One node of the bounded predicate tree a business-record browse is allowed to express.

 * Browse accepts no SQL and no expression string: a caller assembles comparison, set, null, text,
 * boolean and relation nodes, and `RecordQuerySpecification` admits the tree only after asking it how
 * large it is. That is why every node reports its own operation count, nesting depth and relation-hop
 * depth — the bounds are settled at construction, before `DoctrineBusinessRecordQueryCompiler` resolves
 * a single handle against the pinned definition. Implementations are immutable, validate their field
 * handles and values as they are built, and name logical handles only, never a physical column.

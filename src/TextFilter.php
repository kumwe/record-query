 * narrow: the compiler renders it as `LOWER(column) LIKE ? ESCAPE '!'` over a single string, text or
 * ascii-string column, having escaped `!`, `%` and `_` in the caller's text first. Matching is therefore
 * case-insensitive, the operator alone decides where the wildcards sit, and a caller cannot widen a

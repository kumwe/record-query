 * Reduces a query literal to the stable form a specification digest and a cursor payload are built on.

 * depend on the value the query means rather than on the PHP type the caller happened to hand over: an
 * `ExactDecimal` and its decimal string, or a `DateTimeImmutable` and its ISO-8601 rendering, collapse
 * to the same text, so two callers expressing the same page get the same digest and can share a
 * cursor. The reduction itself is `RecordValueGuard`'s; this type exists so the query layer depends on
 * one narrow entry point rather than on the record domain's wider guard.

 * equality test against null the way a caller expects — which is also why `ComparisonFilter` refuses a
 * null literal and points here. The compiler renders the node as `IS NULL`, or `IS NOT NULL`, over
 * every physical column the field occupies and joins those tests with `AND`, so a field stored across
 * several columns is empty only when every one of its columns is null, and filled only when none is.

 * a client sent back. Construction is therefore where an untrusted payload is checked, which is why
 * nothing but a hex digest, a UUID record key, and at most the five sort values a query may sort by
 * survives it. The digest names the exact query the position belongs to;

 * over rows the original query never matched.

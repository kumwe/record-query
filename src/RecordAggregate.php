 * One summary column a report query asks the database to compute over the records a filter selects.

 * A projection carries a list of these, and each names the alias its result comes back under together
 * with the function and, for every function but `Count`, the field to compute it over. The constructor
 * settles the part of the pairing that needs no definition — a count takes no field, everything else
 * requires one — so an inconsistent aggregate cannot be built at all. The rest stays with
 * `DoctrineBusinessRecordQueryCompiler`, which resolves the handle and additionally demands that the
 * field be reportable, visible to the caller, and stored in a single column of a type the chosen
 * function answers exactly.
